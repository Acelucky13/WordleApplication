# Project 2 - *WordleApp*

Submitted by: **Miguel Gomez**

**Wordle** is an app that I was able to help build with the knowledge given by codepath and their tutors help 

[TODO] 

Time spent: **24** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [ ] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [ ] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [ ] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [ ] the functionality of the app is perfectly fine, but adding a color button changing app would make it more fun, and attract younger adutlts, and kids too.

## Video Walkthrough
